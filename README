== Welcome to TIMEBANK

TIMEBANK is a social currency app, based on a conversation paradigm.

Each social interchange is started by a user engaging in a conversation about
another user's announcement. The conversation is then eventually closed, 
possibly with a social currency transaction between the users' accounts.

The currently used currency is "hours".
